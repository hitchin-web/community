# Hitchin Web Code of Conduct

Hitchin Web is a welcoming and inclusive community for anyone interested in building things for the Web, professionally or otherwise. Our meetups are social, technical, and open to all experience levels. We expect all members to engage respectfully and considerately to ensure a positive experience for everyone.

## **Be Respectful and Inclusive**

- Treat all members with respect, regardless of background, experience, or specialisation.
- Keep discussions constructive and inclusive—avoid jargon-heavy conversations that may exclude others present.
- Engage in discussions with curiosity, respect different viewpoints and avoid dismissive comments about technologies or preferences.
- Be mindful of your impact in online and in-person discussions.

## **Be Considerate in Social and Public Spaces**

- Many of our meetups are in public spaces—please be mindful of noise levels and considerate of venue staff.
- Drinking is optional, and no one should feel pressured to consume alcohol. Excessive drunkenness or inappropriate behaviour will not be tolerated.
- Buying drinks for others is fine, but always ask first. The organisers will not track informal arrangements like buying rounds.

## **No Harassment or Discriminatory Behaviour**

- Harassment, offensive jokes, or discriminatory language will not be tolerated.
- Keep discussions professional—avoid sharing inappropriate content in any community spaces (WhatsApp, Meetup, etc.).
- If someone asks you to stop a behaviour that is making them uncomfortable, respect their request.

## **No Commercial Promotion or Unsolicited Contact**

- The group is a space for learning and networking, not sales or recruitment.
- If someone asks for job leads or service recommendations, sharing is fine, but unsolicited promotion is not allowed.
- Do not use WhatsApp or Meetup contact details for unsolicited messages.

## **Reporting Concerns**

- If you experience or witness behaviour that goes against this Code of Conduct, please report it directly to the organisers in person, via Meetup or WhatsApp.
- The organisers will handle all concerns with discretion and will take appropriate action.
- Minor breaches may result in a warning. Serious breaches (e.g., harassment) may result in immediate removal from the group.
